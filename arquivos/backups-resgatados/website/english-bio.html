		<font class="TextoDamiao">Understanding Damião Experiença</font><br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This biography is based in the book of Damião, found in this web site, and also in personal made 
        interviews with him, however without existing registers; Damião does not let himself be recorded or filmed so far.
        <br><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born in the state of Bahia, the city of Portão, close to Salvador. Damião at 13 years old runs away from his house to 
		escape the brutality of his parents who beat him with handle liana, and as clandestine he travels in a ship to 
		Rio De Janeiro. Arriving, he starts to live in the night with the prostitutes, discovering the world early; as 
		he starves, he decides to join the Brazilian navy to be able to eat. Exchanges of job n times, learns to be a man 
		in the streets. He frequents brothels, decides to live with a prostitute in a palafita house, being expelled from the 
		navy therefore. He repents, after 15 days he comes back toward the quarter and gets 1 year of jail, 1 month of lone 
		confinement. He leaves transformed; there he knew the Lamma Planet (Lamma in Portuguese also means mud.) 
		Damião entered Ferreira Da Cruz, left Damião Experyença.
        <br><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He starts to paint, paints a picture called Planeta Lamma, starts to learn music in the jail 
		with the friends, we are in the 60s, pre-dictatorship, and the hippie age is in its fullness. Damião is in middle.
		<br><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he leaves the jail he turns into a radar operator, and after one year due to an accident 
		(or who knows for convenience maybe ?) the navy retires him. Damião is back to the streets, returns to the profession 
		that followed him since early day - PIMP. He uses the money profit from the prostitutes to record his albums, starting with 
		the first one in 1974, called Planeta Lamma, recorded solo, a guitar with only 1 string, 1 rattle hung in the 
		guitar to make percussion and an harmonica attached to the neck. Magnificent record, recorded all in the dialect of the 
		Planeta Lamma, language that the people of the infinite taught him, this record is available entire in the 
		site for download and has 13 tracks with high level of creativity. The dialect of Planet Lamma exists, it's real and 
		Daminhão talks to you whenever you want to, in the dialect. He can sing all the songs of all the records which were 
		made in the dialect exactly the same way, he can talk using this dialect, he translates entire phrases to the dialect. 
		He repeats everything again and again, the same way.
		<br><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the first one to the record of number 34, there goes 30 years of writings, and history 
		goes on. The second record comes, two strings in the guitar, third record with three strings, the fourth with four and 
		fifth, obviously, with five. When six strings were reached he initiated what we call the second phase. 
		You can check the first phase going to Discography page and hearing what is labeled under - Phase 1.
		<br><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Daminhão retires the rattle and inserts one bongo and one marimba initiating what we 
		call second phase, music here is  more mature, has a balance between the dialect of the Lamma Planet and the conventional 
		Portuguese (with slices of Spanish). A synchronized percussion exists, the harmonica solos, rhythm and marimba, turns, 
		taking the universe in its sound. You can check out the second phase in the Discography page.
		<br><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third phase initiates, where Daminhão mixes his writings, his acoustics previous 
		recordings with the sound of a rock band creating the systematic chaos. It is the more tormented part of his work, 
		sometimes having five overlapped songs, all sung in the dialect, with unfhatomable bases, many surprising lyrics also. 
		The matrices of records are overlapped and generate new music. Releases in this phase his self biography, available 
		in the site, in the Book section. That is his first and only book. Third fase is available at Discography for download.
		<br><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damião initiates the fourth phase recording with a band, and launches amazing records 
		through his label, Lamma Planet that has a band; the band Lamma Planet, according to him formed by today famous 
		musicians of TV and media, whose names he does not disclose. The lyrics are created in the spot, and sounds like 
		1970's rock songs, with some songs as exceptions, working in the previous formula.
        <br><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here starts the fifth phase, where Damião writes the lyrics first, and sings on rock heavy 
		bases (as he says it) already in the 80s, more inside the tempo, with start and end, and continues in this format 
		until stopping in 1992 with the last record - Command Lamma Planet.
		<br><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 30 years of career, tired of the public debauch, the lack of support and the media in 
		general ignoring his work, poor as all we are after catastrophic economic plans, he retires, forgets his records and 
		loses the matrices of the LPs in flooding that occurs in the bathroom of his house. He is half inmate, 
		receives few visits, sells all of his remaining records, when not, just distributes them. Sporadically writes 
		something or records something acoustic in his guitar, thinking about one day to release a piece of his work 
		in the CD format.
		<br><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ironically, when Daminhão believes that the world had forgotten his work, 
		we at Portão do Daminhão initiates our activities in 2001, rescuing records of the Daminhão, divulging the artist and 
		trying to place him in return with messages for the people of the planet Earth (calling planet earth…) and arriving 
		now in 2004 trying to release the work of the Daminhão and creating a Portal for all of his fans and who 
		believes in a different way to make and to hear music.

		this is art.<br>
		<br>
		- What is the dialect of the Lamma Planet ?<br>
		It is a language taught him by the people of the infinite of 1999, but you can believe that Damiao has created it,

		<i><b>which man, which woman does not like to make a 1969 ?</b></i> As for the number 1999, it fills all of his work 
		and doesn't have an explanation (at least a rational one).<br>
		<br>
		- Is Damiao Experyenca influenced by Jimmy Hendrix Experience?<br>
		In the beginning he was, later changed because he, Damião, were more complex, in his words: 
		<i><b>Everything is experyença, and not experience, because experience everybody can make, but the experyença - being 
		different and not being experience - it is in each thing that you do, only the experyença, because with the time 
		it does not cease... </b></i> (English here is not wrong. It is the way Damião spoke...).<br>

		correctly. What can I do ?<br>
		Learn Portuguese, it's easy and fun. You will love 10 verbal tenses and 60 verbal flexions.<br>
		<br>		
		- Why is the site called Portão and not Portal ?<br>
		Because Daminhão was born in the city of Portão in the state of Bahia in the country named Brazil, and that is one 
		linguistic joke, in Portuguese only.<br>
		<br>
		- Do all these bands listed in the site have influences of Daminhão? <br>
		Yes, if not heard in the lyrics or the sound, it's in the attitude of the musicians.<br>
		<br>
		- Was the Rastafarian hair of Damião influenced by Bob Marley?<br>
		No. Daminhão made his Rasta before Marley, by his own inspiration, much before reggae, in the 60s. He laments for 
		having done one Rasta in Brazil, where he was not taken seriously.<br>
		<br>
		- Is Damião a Rastafarian, or has he any link with the religion / movement Rasta?<br>
		No, he is not, and he does not have any link. He is Rastafarian of the Country (sort of hillbilly Rastafarian)<br>
		<br>
		- Did Damião ever go back to Portão, his homeland ?<br>
		No and he will never go. The world raised him and it is his house. He does not know the way his family took and 
		he never looked for them.<br>
		<br>
		- Which one of his records and songs does he like the most ?<br>
		All of them, he does not have any favorites.<br>
		<br>
		- Why do the numbers, the amount of records seem so&nbsp;strange ? 28, 34, 13?<br>
		There is not one model to use in order to count the number of the records. Sometimes each side of the LP is a record, 
		like Planet Hen and Bocagi, in the case of Planeta Lamma both sides are one record. The counting is more or less for 
		the number of sides with different names, what it seems to be the model that the Damião uses. When we asked, 
		he didn’t understand, either.<br>
		<br>
		- Why is there an obsession on Damião side with sugar cane, Caiana cane, Cuban cane, to plant sugar cane, to suck 
		sugar cane, etc ?<br>
		
		In Brazil of the 60s and 70s communists believed that a test of real filiations to the socialism/communism of the time 
		was to go to work as cutter of sugar cane in the plantations of Cuba, to show that all were equal and that even 
		doctors cut sugar cane (sic!!!), besides the fact that Cuba had a school of guerrillas where the people of 
		Latin America trained and learned interesting topics as: - Mounting your own guerrilla, - How to knock down governments, 
		- Setting coup d etat, How to oppress the proletarians, and so on. Damião probably drank of this belief. 
		In conversations with him he told us he had lived in Cuba and in Trinidad Tobago.<br>
		<br>
		- Does Damião have similars?<br>
		Like him ? Only himself. Some comparisons do exist, of some elements, for example, by the set of his work the comparison 
		is made with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071009181042/http://www.sunraresearch.com/" class="TextoLink2" target="_blank">Sun Ra</a>,
		for the psycodelism rock and the quantity of LPs to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071009181042/http://www.zappa.com/" class="TextoLink2" target="_blank">Frank Zappa</a>,
		for the politic posture and the way of expressing various cultures to 
		<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071009181042/http://www.felaproject.net/" class="TextoLink2" target="_blank">Fela Kutti</a>, for the creativity to 
		<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071009181042/http://www.johncoltrane.com/" class="TextoLink2" target="_blank">Coltrane</a>, for the noise to 
		<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071009181042/http://www.ayler.supanet.com/" class="TextoLink2" target="_blank">Albert Ayler</a>, etc. There's an american 
		called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071009181042/http://tisue.net/jandek/" class="TextoLink2" target="_blank">Jandek</a> who has a lot in common with 
		Damião despite the distance of the countries, songs with short names and lonely minimalist guitar, very personal covers, 
		improvised lyrics, great number of records and distance of the press, sees link for his site in the Followers section.<br>
		<br>
		-  I have a record which is the same of a frend of mine, however with different cover ! How is it possible ?<br>
		The only two records that have their own cover are the first and the second, which contains the name of the tracks in the back. 
		The others do not have a defined cover, Damião printed a lot of covers and used to pick the first in front of him 
		(including here some covers from the first and the second albums remaining), and put the vinyl inside, so you never know 
		which one is it.<br>
		<br>
		- My record says in the label one track only, but in the vinyl they are 5. Is it a mistake?<br>
		No, it is not. Damião sometimes unites four or five songs under the same title. Sometimes he gives the same name to 
		different songs. Other times you will only have a track but in the cover 8 names are shown.<br>
		<br>
		- Daminhão never recorded for a big label, a major ?<br>
		He was been invited some times, but along with each invitation always came a restrictive papal brief of behavior, 
		appearance, lyrics, sounds, way of being and Daminhão always found of good tone to say  - NO -. He is contrary to sign 
		in contracts, as he says - <i><b>I am a loose animal</b></i>.<br>
		<br>
		- What does it meas this symbol found in the cover of some records and drawings ?<br>

		<br>
		- Who is the author of all the songs ?<br>
		All songs, lyrics, arrangements, regency, orchestration, covers are authorship of Damião Ferreira Da Cruz, 
		which is Daminhão Experyença.<br>
		<br>
		- What do you gain with this ?<br>
		Friends, knowledge and recognition to Daminhão, around the world. Experyença, and we can say that it has been more 
		valid day by day, it doesn’t cease.<br>
		<br>
		- Do you have&nbsp;plans for the future? Or for the future of the site?<br>
		Yes, indeed.<br>
		1 - A band like Lounge Lizards, here in São Paulo (ma vlatva) (looking for musicians, if you are interested yourself 
		drop us an email),
		2 - To release some of the LPS of Damião in Brazil and in the world
		3 - To make some shows with him.
		4 - To record a new work with Damiao, all money reverted for him,
		5 - To record a new LP with Damião, as one of his musicians (which means not to get credit for what you play hahahahaha)
		6 - Release in  this year (2004) a tribute to Damião with the bands of this site, influenced by the work of the master.
		7 - Sets of documentaries and videos would be of good tone also and are in the agenda.<br>
